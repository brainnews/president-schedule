            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>President Schedule is a non-partisan public resource that tracks and displays the daily schedule of the sitting U.S. President. We aggregate information from official sources, press briefings, pool reports, and verified social media accounts to provide transparent, accessible information about how the President spends their time and taxpayer resources.</p>

            <h2>What We Track</h2>
            <p>Our platform provides comprehensive tracking of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily Schedule:</strong> Events, meetings, briefings, and public appearances from multiple verified sources</li>
                <li><strong>Travel Costs:</strong> Estimated costs of presidential travel based on official government reports</li>
                <li><strong>Property Visits:</strong> Visits to Trump-owned properties during weekdays (excluding weekends and holidays)</li>
                <li><strong>Lid Time:</strong> Hours when the President is unavailable to the press ("lid called")</li>
                <li><strong>Days in Office:</strong> Official time served since inauguration</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p>We collect schedule information from the following sources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Press Briefing:</strong> Official White House press briefings</li>
                <li><strong>Official Schedule:</strong> White House official schedule releases</li>
                <li><strong>Pool Call Time:</strong> White House press pool notifications</li>
                <li><strong>@POTUS_Schedule:</strong> Verified social media accounts tracking presidential movements</li>
                <li><strong>Pool Reports:</strong> Reports from the White House press pool</li>
                <li><strong>Axios:</strong> Verified news reporting from Axios</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>

            <h3>Mar-a-Lago Travel Costs</h3>
            <p>Travel cost estimates are based on a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report</a> that estimated $3.4 million per round trip to Mar-a-Lago during the first Trump administration. This figure includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Air Force One operating costs</li>
                <li>Security personnel and Coast Guard operations</li>
                <li>Support aircraft and ground transportation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We count "trips" as visits separated by more than one day at other locations (not consecutive days at Mar-a-Lago).</p>

            <h3>Trump Property Visits</h3>
            <p>We track weekday (Monday-Friday) visits to Trump-owned properties, excluding federal holidays. The list of properties is compiled from public records and verified sources including <a href="https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/TrumpProperties.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal reporting</a>.</p>

            <h3>Lid Time Calculation</h3>
            <p>"Lid" refers to when the White House press office announces the President will have no further public events for the day. We calculate the hours from the lid call time until midnight (end of workday) and provide both total hours and daily averages.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>This is an open-source project built with vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks). The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/brainnews/president-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p>Key features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time data fetching from a Cloudflare Worker API</li>
                <li>Automatic local backup system for offline access</li>
                <li>Client-side filtering and search</li>
                <li>Responsive design for mobile and desktop</li>
                <li>Cache-busting system for always-fresh content</li>
            </ul>
